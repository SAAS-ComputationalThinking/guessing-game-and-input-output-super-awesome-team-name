# guessing-game

You are going to make a web page that has two pieces to it, a guessing game (example here:  https://itmeson.github.io/guessing-game/) and and "input-output" (example here:  https://itmeson.github.io/input-output/).  You may not look at the source code for those pages, nor may you use generative AI tools for this assignment.  You may use resources like stack overflow, Mozilla Developer Network, and w3schools for examples.

1. Accept the assignment, then clone the repository into vscode on each of your computers.
2. Then have one driver (typer) create empty files called "index.html", "style.css", and "script.js" while the navigator (director) talks about what they should do
3. Write the outline of the index file, with two sections in it, one for the guessing game and the other for the input-output
4. Commit the changes, then push them to github
5. Then have your partner "pull" the changes onto their computer and switch roles for the next part.
6. Play with the two websites so you understand what they do, and begin building the elements of the page in the index file, changing their look with the style file, and then ask questions and research to figure out how to use the script file to make the functionality work.
7. As you work, whenever you make significant changes, test them in the browser and then commit and push them to github, then have your partner "pull" the changes and swap roles again.
